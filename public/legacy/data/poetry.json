Ultimately, the piece describes a significant toxic emotional encounter that leaves the subject emotionally distressed. However, as the subject attempts to forget the first instance, trying to mend the situation, the same encounter occurs once more. Finally, the subject builds up despise for the situation that led him to these encounters in the first place and announces himself as his foremost priority, looking out for himself.\n            </i><br /><br /> Silence kept the peace in me when I feared the storm<br /> A shelter to heal and hide from the truth<br /> It hurts<br /> The scar is now too deep<br /> The storm ravaged<br /> Damage is done<br /> Tranquil\n            <br /> You would think it is summer breeze before it's too late\n            <br /> It blew the land upside down<br /> Green is grey<br /> A flower blooms<br /> But just as I turn to smell the reminiscence<br /> The storm blows again<br /> \"I don't like flowers anymore,\" I said<br />\n            <br />\n        </p>\n        <h4>Red Bricks</h4>\n        <p class=\"no-indent\"><i class=\"caption\">\n                        \u201cConsumed\u201d discusses an issue of self-harm, where each line employs a different kind of imagery. The self-harm depicted in the piece occurs through the means of punching a solid body, ideally a concrete wall. The first line describes the wall as \"red bricks\" and links it in the second line with the idea of \"punching\" using the image of a destroyed wall \"grey ruins.\" It quickly likens the idea to roses, giving a satisfactory feeling like the flower but also associated with thorns. From there, the author shifts once more to describe self-harm and connects roses to the act of punching by likening the roses to rings, where the pointy side faces the bare flesh and unleashes the blood, his soul, out. In the next three lines, the author symbolizes the blood rushing out with an empty wine bottle after a hangover and then announces that it also leaves a mark on the rundown wall. Following the repetition, the author announces that the thorny roses fit his finger no more as he loses his soul and remains a moving empty casket.\n                      </i><br /><br />Red bricks<br/> Grey Ruins<br/> Thorny roses<br/> That fit nicely<br/> A ring around my finger<br/> Poking my soul to go back<br/> Consumed\n            <br/> A bottle of red wine after a hangover<br/> Until my soul reunites with the rubble<br/><br/> Red bricks<br/> Grey Ruins<br/> Thorny roses<br/> That fit nicely<br/> Around my empty casket<br/>\n        </p>\n\n        <h4>Sound of Love</h4>\n        <p class=\"no-indent\">\n            <i class=\"caption\">\u201cSound of Love\u201d creates the image of a speaking subject with a vivacious voice, before ultimately revealing that this voice is a symbolization of the feeling of love. The piece portrays the long-term effect of love on the lover, bringing the subject peace in times of loneliness, in dreams, and through depression. \n                        <br></i><br> Your voice brings peace unto me<br/> A piece of heaven dwelling on our land<br/> Magical and charming, its merry notes<br/> Chirping like a mockingbird<br/> I might ask if I could<br/> To hear it all-day<br/>            And I feel like hearing it in the memories of my<br/> dreams,\n            <br/> in the lonely nights,<br/> amid the darkness of my thoughts<br/> The void in my veins dissipates in its utterance<br/> And my name, in your notes, slashes like a cupid<br/> through my heart<br/> Oh, shall it be?<br/> The sound of love\n            <br/>\n        </p>\n        <h4>Autumn Leaves</h4>\n        <p class=\"no-indent\">\n            <i class=\"caption\">\n                        \u201cAutumn Leaves\u201d is a haiku-influenced piece, although longer and free of haiku restrictions.
