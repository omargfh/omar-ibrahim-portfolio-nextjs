[{"title": "The Evil Condominium", "year": 2020, "nyear": "20", "image": "/legacy/images/articles/evilcondo.webp", "credits": "byMarcus Loke on Unsplash", "category": "Prose", "cols": 1, "content": "<p>It has not been long since Adam Anderson returned to his old, austere apartment in Mary\u2019s street before he became baffled with the disparity between the image of it he had in mind and what he came to discover. Although the tableau-less walls of imperfect white paint effortlessly trying to cover the gray patches of concrete and the wood-colored furniture remained intact and in their designated places (maybe with minor changes), Adam did feel an unexpected ambivalence. Maybe because of quite a few changes that might have happened to the rest of Mary\u2019s Street.</p><p>Adam\u2019s apartment sits on the western coast of Lincoln city facing the massive greenery that surrounds the Lincoln-PD precinct from one side and facing an oases desert landscape from the other. His apartment (1-11) landed on the first floor of a white condominium cluster coated with many other apartments enough to make him lose count\u2014he was barely familiar with his (2-17) neighbors, let alone anybody else. Most of his neighbors might have had a couple of encounters with him enough to make his name bellringing but not close to creating a lasting bond between him and anybody. Adam, however, preferred a more distant bond. To the east bank of Lincoln\u2019s river, Adam enjoyed the company of Tara Wilson and her friends, deeming him more concealed with his neighbors but far more open to possibilities in that foreign environment.</p><p>Mr. Anderson, as he was often called, faced difficulties re-settling in a condominium cluster that he described as <i>\u201ca land of hate, envy, and vandalism.\u201d</i> For him, the people boarding the same artificial housing structure he lodges had some sort of evil crawling their bones: an evil condominium. The evil he saw in the eyes of Alex that same October\u2013and in his own, before he shot himself with the same P1911 he was reported for conspiring to use in a planned murder.</p><p><i>\u201cPlease, Adam, understand that I did not know it would go this far,\u201d</i> Alex called from across the JailGaurd after reporting Adam for conspiracy of murder and vandalism. All fingers pointed at Adam and his network of phishing websites and click baits. They were enough to swat him and get him in jail. <i>\u201cI had to do something. You were ruining lives. I had to intervene,\u201d</i> but Adam knew these words were far from being the truth. Alex has had him in mind for a while, trying to stop him from landing a 1.5-million-dollar deal for the company they both worked for\u2014the envy of a colleague. Maybe Adam was really conspiring for murder, but he was fully aware that Alex did not rat him for the sake of a better society or engendered fear.</p><p>Barely a week, a casual visit to (1-09), and a friendly trust Adam was not known to give out\u2026 those were enough to situate Adam at his doomed cold county jail awaiting an unfair trial for a crime he may or may have not committed. Adam has been working his way around that deal for months. Praised by the whole board of administration, they promised Adam a substantial promotion for his endeavors. He worked around landing that deal with a flabbergasting proposal and most of his top-tier team working on the testing trials for their prospective client. However, Adam had his face full of awe on the sight of the testing reports that could waste him months of work; the numbers did not add up.</p><p>Adam might have evaded himself all the trouble in a perfect plan that would have pushed the boundaries of his current life class if he did not seek help from his (1-09) colleague\u2014and you might wonder what makes Adam think immediately of Alex for technical help aside from working at the same company when (1-12) lodged someone perfectly suited for that job, but Adam couldn\u2019t stop himself from pulling a toxic flex. Alex\u2019s envy for Adam never dissipated his face; he did not even show an effort to hide it, and Adam was content by telling himself that he is not flexing\u2014that he is just an extraverted person who loves to share. For someone like Alex, all he could see is an opportunity to wear his nemesis down, interpreting the numbers to be deliberate breaches and phishing attempts to convince an unwary client. Those numbers could have been anything from serious attacks to Adam threatening a client with murder through their servers to land a deal, and it is easy to tell what story Alex claimed to have evidence for. He affirmed to have reported it to a senior colleague out of friendliness and worry for his fellow. He was lying.</p><p>While Adam might have felt a comforting vibe in the county jail that did not look much worse than a self-abnegating condo, he was soon bailed out before the trial scheduled in three months\u2014a result of some strings being pulled here and there. Adam\u2019s ravaging anger rectified to the point that he would pull a gun on Alex if he bumped into him in a corridor, but he did not\u2014not yet. Not to anybody\u2019s surprise, Adam became the talk of the whole city\u2014from Mary\u2019s street on the west coast to Boulder county on by the west. The loath of the condominium cluster to Adam become more vibrant\u2014he has always hated that place. At least before, it used to smell of Windex and Comfy, but now all he can smell is the vomit he asphyxiates on in his late-night nightmares. Too many people have told Adam all sorts of stories about what had led him there, some through the JailGaurd, some when he got back home. The stories conflicted in parts and agreed in others. Some were a unilateral addition to the timeline, but felt logical, so Adam believed them as he drafted the course of what happened through the past few days. Others, however, were unanimous, but shady, and felt like a cover-up. No one knew what Adam was capable of doing to Alex, and no one dared to experiment. It was some sort of agreed-on protection that not even Alex asked for.</p><p>The condominium had gone on a rampage for Adam. He was detested and frowned upon. He was getting further and further from everyone around him each day. By December, he was as lonely as the last tree leaf in the winter. He had only remained close to his last friend, Tara Wilson, getting closer every day. The more the evil condominium hated Adam, the more he felt an attachment for her. They weren\u2019t lovers, but they always resembled two lovebirds\u2014confused, and the condominium brought the confusion even further. Adam knew that his life was voided when he decided to let her be his only friend, and he did feel the lonesome breeze when she would take her personal time\u2014time off a complicated life of the condominium cluster society, something that took anywhere from a couple of days to a couple of weeks at a time. The void greeted Adam in the morning and filled him with anxiety to sleep. </p><p>You could say that he forgave Alex, but he did not. If you have known Adam by then, you would be surprised by the fact that he never revenged. Something inside was turning into a different color\u2014glowing in a unique way Adam has never experienced amidst the toxicity of the condominium cluster. Maybe he was trying to care for someone for the first time in his life\u2014and that\u2019s not Alex. Adam cared for Tara enough that he did not want her to see him as someone evil, and that was the first time Adam realized he was evil\u2014he saw the same gleam in Alex\u2019s eyes but in his. It is hard to make such a realization\u2014for Adam, many memories of wickedness washed over him\u2026 ones he never realized before. He had to face the mirror every time he enters through the condominium cluster entrance or in the bathroom\u2014only seeing a shade of vomiting green covering what he thought was the flesh of innocence. His aura, all in black. He would also see the reason why he can see his true colors now\u2014Tara Wilson definitely meant something to him.</p><p>Would he ever tell her of his love? Adam kept thinking, denying, refusing to believe loving someone, but he knew that the smell of vomit of the evil condominium dissipates when he thinks about her\u2014overtaken by roses and jasmines, but Tara was much more of a stubborn person\u2026 she did not want that. <i>\u201cHow would it feel when the last person in your life puts you down, too, Adam,\u201d</i> he wondered to himself. <i>\u201cIt\u2019s dark in here. I feel the walls closing on me. I\u2019m devoured by the ghosts of darkness. It is not supposed to be like this; why would Tara just leave? I am not good enough for her: I know I only look out for myself, but I wanted to look out for her too; I\u2019m afraid of the dark. Help\u2026,\u201d</i> he barely breathed in reply to himself. Adam was no longer tolerating what became of him. <i>\u201cIt\u2019s dark in here. I can\u2019t breathe. Please help\u2026,\u201d</i> but no one listened; Adam did not have anybody to help him. </p><p>The air breeze as the new year welcomed was heartwarming in Mary\u2019s street condominiums. Despite the coldness of winter, it did feel so sincere and lovely. Maybe nobody came to help Adam and that\u2019s why nobody saw him in the new year celebrations. Maybe everyone was busy hanging decorations and filling candy socks over their mantelpieces. Maybe that\u2019s why no one found Adam for a week to come\u2026 covered with blood, a result of a P1911 gunshot\u2026 in his evil condominium.</p><p>While Adam might have felt a comforting vibe in the county jail that did not look much worse than a self-abnegating condo, he was soon bailed out before the trial scheduled in three months\u2014a result of some strings being pulled here and there.

The white room deforms its cubic shape, extruding in the direction of his sight into a\n    long corridor.\n</p>\n<p><i>\u201cYou are nowhere,\u201d</i> a voice replies, startling the child. The man seemed as if he spawned on spot, standing peacefully behind the child.</p>\n<p><i>\u201cIf I am nowhere, then what is this?\u201d</i> the child questioned, looking intrigued. </p>\n<p><i>\u201cThis is nothing,\u201d</i> the man traverses the dimensions of the room with his eyes.</p>\n<p><i>\u201cThen, what am I doing here?\u201d</i> </p>\n<p><i>\u201cThe impossible, something deemed by all of your kind, irrational, yet they do every day.\u201d</i></p>\n<p><i>\u201c...and what should that be?\u201d</i></p>\n<p><i>\u201cYou are dividing by zero,\u201d</i> the man announced.</p>\n<p><i>\u201cDividing? Zero?\u201d</i> the child figure thought to himself. He may have not been alive for long, but the idea seemed out of place. <i>\u201cHow can you divide by nothing?\u201d</i> his thoughts followed.</p>\n<p><i>\u201cLet me answer the question. Come with me,\u201d</i> the man responded to the unspoken question as the walls fell into oblivion, revealing the suspended transparent corridor in the middle of a nebula, overseeing Earth. As the two wanderers walk across the\n    corridor, the man begins:</p>\n<p> <i>\u201cSee, child, this is your home. It is just like this room, nothing. Take a good look, you are spending a lot of time here. </p>\n<p>Look around and above, every person you will get to meet lodges this finite sphere of nothingness. Your kind will cross sea and land, star and planet, to find another of their kind, or any kind at all. I never heard they were lucky.</p>\n<p>It is scary how oblivious the universe is to their existence, yet they will baffle you. You will see bullies, haters, criminals, wars, deaths, famines. You will see people fighting over chunks of this insignificant void.</p>\n<p>Your kind has defined the universe in their own existence, and they started the endless cycle of refuting the most basic rules of nature. Every day, the universe is, in a sense, divided over them\u2014determined through their presence, but what are they, if\n    they are not a zero?\u201d</i></p>\n<p><i>\u201cI could be a little slow, mind my age, but what does it mean to divide?\u201d</i></p>\n<p><i>\u201cIn your world, to divide is to spread evenly. That is what makes division over zero impossible: you simply cannot spread over \u2018nothing\u2019. Here, to divide is to think the universe is spread evenly over you or your kind alone, to think that your actions\n    are of cosmic importance, just like your kind have been doing forever.\u201d</i></p>\n<p><i>\u201cSo, what am I? A nothing?\u201d</i></p>\n<p><i>\u201cIn your eyes, you are not,\u201d</i> the man said as he ushered the child to look down into Earth as the corridor teleported their figures into a classroom scene. The man pointed to the 14-year-old, seated alone, reading a copy of Thus Spoke Zarathustra\n    for Nietzsche; you can feel discomfort in his posture, who would befriend someone like that?:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cThat is you, and right now, how loneliness hurts you is of cosmic importance to you, yet to the universe, you and your kind are \u2018undefined\u2019 in the division. Your actions and desires remain minuscule in a heavenly equation. It sounds purposeless so long\n    that you are thinking as if you matter to the skies. However, the equation of the universe is not the only one that exists. There is of your planet, and your country, and your city, and your school, and your class, and then comes yours. In your equation,\n    you do not stand as a zero; you have a value, because, from your perspective, you are everything that defines your existence. Cogito, ergo sum: you think, therefore you are. You read that somewhere.\u201d</i></p>\n<p><i>\u201cSo, you brought me here to continue this cycle, to divide by zero? What is the point?\u201d</i></p>\n<p><i>\u201cYes and no,\u201d</i> the corridor shifts into a high school campus. The child sees his older self trying to make friends after spending years of loneliness during middle school. <i>\u201cOne day, you will grow to learn the true meaning of friendship, and in your equation,\n    you will stop feeling lonely; in their equation, you will be a lifelong friend to remember.\u201d</i> The corridor shifts again into a classroom, a one in which the child\u2019s older self is standing for the fourth hour, giving his weekly lectures. <i>\u201cThen, you\n    will be back into a classroom, but this time, you will stand confident instead of hurt: you will be the influence to the few dozens now before you continue to influence thousands, being more than nothing in all of their equations.\u201d</i> The corridor\n    shifts once more into the dorm room: the child sees grown-up him staring at the sky. <i>\u201cThen, one day, you stare out your window at Jupiter and Saturn, and you will write the many poems you keep today in your notes, how the cosmos reminded you of the one person\n    you loved so dearly, how the cosmos reminded you of your friends, and how it reminded you of how you are constantly dividing by zero.\u201d</i></p>\n<p><i>\u201cWhy? Why are you telling me all of that?\u201d</i></p>\n<p><i>\u201cBecause, my child, on the day you stared at Jupiter and Saturn, I was born: an older you. You wrote me in a poem to remind yourself that the universe is expansive compared to our puny essence, an influence of \u2018Man\u2019s Search for Meaning\u2019 probably. You\n    wanted me to stop you from getting overwhelmed in the personal success that you forget to live, to be human. You needed to understand that no matter how attractive the prize was, in the end, it was another division by zero, and you felt the need to\n    be reminded that your equation and the equations of others matters more, so that you will never be consumed enough to hurt others while attempting to prosper your equation. It was a time of realization for you, how you should never be blinded by personal\n    desires when they can cause hurt people around you, especially yourself.\u201d</i></p>\n<p><i>\u201c...and will I remember any of this?\u201d</i></p>\n<p><i>\u201cOne day, you will stare at the sky, and I will flow into a poem of yours...</p>...as our never-ending cycle continues\u2014the division by zero.\u201d</i>", "side": "<p class=\"no-indent\">* picture by Mahir Uysal on Unsplash</p><p class=\"no-indent\">This essay discusses a personal view of human existence from the dual-perspective of existentialism and relativism.

He detested the sight, longing for his other persona with its captivating appeal even if it always got under his skin. Sprawled on the ground next to Adam were pictures: a photograph of Adam staring dumbfounded to the camera, another in grade-school where he smiles at his best friend, and a photo from middle school night over when he stayed up designing posters with a friend who just lost her cat. Although none taken at the same time, they all shared one fundamental element: innocence, the type that tended to fade as people\u2019s hair traversed lighter shades of grey. The observer couldn\u2019t hide his disgust of Adam, secretly wishing to be like the other: Akkademi. <i>\u201cWhat good would being nice ever bring me when all are beasts with nothing but ruthless competition in their hearts?\u201d</i>\u00a0</p><p><i>\u201cWhat are you doing standing over there? \u201d</i> Akkademi questioned as he approached the observer\u2019s sight of the mirror realm, pushing Adam away. <i>\u201cStand there and you will scare the man for life,\u201d</i> he chuckled, when Adam could do nothing but mockingly stare. By Akkademi\u2019s foot lay another parade of photographs\u2014ones that spanned high school this time: one had Akkademi cramming for his finals, in the fear of someone outpacing him. Akkademi never knew how to get enough, bringing into life non-existent competitors to compete against when none was left. Another picture shows Akkademi standing proudly, a certificate in hand with a broad grin on his face, boldly looking at the camera\u2019s lens. In the last one, he is surrounded by 20-something of his friends\u2014even if none of them were ever close\u2014and hanging his arms around two.\u00a0</p><p>In every aspect, Adam and Akkademi were the two opposite poles of a magnet, failing to co-exist at the same place and time.\u00a0</p><p><i>\u201cCower in fear like you always do with that\u2026 whatchamacallit... emotions of yours,\u201d</i> Akkademi kept his mockery on display. <i>\u201cRemind me, where are all your imaginary middle school friends again? When were they when you found nobody on your side!\u201d</i></p><p>Akkademi never believed in emotions or people of any kind. He always saw himself as his own protector and believed in the pride of the fruit of his own hands.</p><p><i>\u201cMy fear? You call it fear?\u201d</i> Adam screamed on top of his lungs, stepping away from his usual silent side. Adam was more sensitive and believed in true friendship, limiting himself to a selected niche. His sensitivity made him more aware of the feelings of those he loved and loved him back.</p><p><i>\u201cWhat else do you call it, young man? How else do you describe yourself?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat you call fear is our savior! Emotions saved us! The people I know saved us when your heart attracted none but those who wished for your defeat when you deemed all people as equal.</p><p>Remind me when all hated you, who out of the hundreds you had by your side stayed? Which of the lot disbelieved the rumors?\u00a0</p><p>Who were the ones who pushed you when you were slacking around, unwary of what others had of hatred in their hearts for you?\u201d</i></p><p>Akkademi felt enraged by Adam\u2019s words for he never liked to lose the position of power, and as this position was exchanged, arguments began to run out. Both characters quarreled, howling their lungs out, and pinning each other to the ground. With their voices resonating across the thin glass of the mirror into the real world, they failed to notice that the ground beneath them was shaking to the frequency of their tunes.\u00a0</p><p>The observer in the real world stands still as the tarnished oak is showered with glass. It only took a fraction of a second to break the pride of Akkademi and the endearment of Adam, breaking the mirror realm into ashes of the past. As the last piece of glass clashed with the ground, a finer, darker sheet of glass showed up from beneath. This sheet had but one reflection to the face of our observer: the face of Omar, realizing his disgust for either Adam or Akkademi was unfounded. Akkademi was the hard-worker and the self-protector, who kept Adam safe at all times, while Adam balanced out the pride of Akkademi, choosing his friends wisely and always bringing with him the emotional and mental support they needed.</p><p>One last photograph lies on the floor next to Omar, the observer, a one from senior year, looking at the camera, smiling with his significant prideful eyes. Two of his friends seated by his side and four on the other dormitory bed, commemorating the night after his Adam stayed up late, mixed with a jolt of Akkademi\u2019s hard-working character, with his friends in need of help with their essays.</p>", "side": "<p class=\"no-indent\">* picture by Frida Bredesen on Unsplash</p><p class=\"no-indent\">Adam, the lenient, encounters Akkademi, the darker, more vigorious version of himself, the callous.

Adam, half-dressed, skimmed a couple of pages of Around the World in 80 Days as he held a bottle of skimmed-milk, ready to put together his daily sum of vanilla-syrup cappuccino. \u201cThis man can\u2019t be real,\u201d Adam mockingly laughs every now and then at the character of Phileas Fogg. Mr. Fogg had his sense of appeal, the same appeal that pulled Adam to Berlin and Dammam; the same tenderness that brings him to remember the Kinderh\u00fctte, playing with kids every weekend, or that one time he spoke to the police officer in fluent German when his mom couldn\u2019t.</p><p>Adam\u2019s enchantment with his past, however, couldn\u2019t overwhelm his derision for Fogg. Only a couple of seconds later, Adam swiftly distances the bottle of skimmed milk as a new feeling overtook him: \u201cMilk doesn\u2019t fit coffee, just like me,\u201d he settles for dark coffee. Adam failed to understand what part of the journey bore interest to Fogg. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t as lonely as I was. At least, he had Passepartout,\u201d Adam explained to himself.</p><p>In so many years, Adam never felt he belonged anywhere, and he couldn\u2019t wrap his head around how Fogg dealt with new cultures. In each of the two countries, Adam had barely any friends. He\u2019d only visit the Kinderh\u00fctte once per week, spending most of his week alone with his favorite reads. Even there, all the kids understood the culture he didn\u2019t get and lived traditions not celebrated in his household. \u201cFogg went to 6 countries and I can\u2019t even survive three,\u201d Adam ridiculed himself.</p><p>Adam puts on his flannel shirt and black denim, almost done with his Saturday ritual before arriving at school for the rest of the week. He sips on his coffee as his face muscles twitch in disgust, not because of the simmering pitch-black coffee but rather the memory of his sophomore year. \u201cThis place is evil,\u201d he believed\u2014two years ago. The place was a boarding school, a one Adam only joined to stay in his hometown\u2014thinking he\u2019d fit there. Having lived in the middle of urban Berlin and the Arab Sahara, Adam couldn\u2019t even fit the molds of a school in his own country: he was as alone as before. </p><p>Before the next sip of coffee, Adam heaves a teaspoon full of sugar into it\u2014rubbing the mouth place of the cup in circles with his index finger. Unlike Foggs, Adam always evaded a part of his identity: he never fully embraced himself. By the time Adam went back to Egypt, he couldn\u2019t call himself solely Egyptian anymore: a part of him begged to differ\u2014the part that elevated into control during the Siwa trip. To the friends he made that day, Adam assimilated three cultures: the Egyptian beauty of Siwa meshed with the long-held tradition of Saudi Arabian grilling in the desert, right next to the many German side dishes he cooked that day.</p><p>It was a time when Adam realized how his exceptional culture is the answer to his desire of belonging; the same answer he gave during classes of Arabic and German, discussing how vocabulary pertain in importance to its culture or its regional varieties, giving his classes a taste of the cultural authenticity. He would debate once the local perception of one word, talk about the different accents in Germany, or tell stories about their unique traditions like Tanz in den Mai or the Tatort.</p><p>Before the last sip of his extra-sugary coffee, Adam puts on his shoes, ready to embark on his journey. \u201cI can be another Fogg,\u201d he notes to himself, thinking of his next destination. He imagines a campus situated in New England\u2019s largest city. A campus that hosts the Cultural Rhythms every year, where Adam could be the western-and-eastern-flavored Egyptian for students who felt left out, believing they had to fit a predefined mold. It is also the same campus of ARTS FIRST, where Adam can showcase his poetry that symbolizes a culture that doesn\u2019t apply to a single geographical location. Over the four years, Adam may also debate lingual intricacies during his linguistic classes from the perspective of three different cultures at once, or might give his house a taste of his quirky cuisine that proudly crosses borders. </p><p>Adam shuts the door behind.</p>", "side": "<p class=\"no-indent\">* picture by Nathan Dumlao on Unsplash</p><p class=\"no-indent\">Isolated and lonely, the authors psuedo-character Adam is presented once again to tell the story of growth into loving every part of himself.

You\u2019re late for our date, as usual. I step outside of our reserved table into the street for a good sense of fresh air. Sometimes I think of what brought me here. Of all the places in the world, you had to choose here. I would have wanted a fancier place for your special day, but then, it had to overlook the Northtower building I hate, so what can a man do? You didn\u2019t even ask me if I\u2019d be comfortable around here or not. Am I? To be honest, I don\u2019t care much. I\u2019m not that kind of a person. It\u2019s 8:30 PM. You\u2019re an hour late. You\u2019re not picking up or texting me back. Excuse me, miss\u2026 but what is happening here? I order a drink for myself\u2026 or two. I should have waited for you because that was enough to get me full.</p><p>The clock strikes 9:00 PM. I stroll down the street once again, but this time I\u2019m leaving. You better have a good explanation for this. \u201cWhere exactly do you think you\u2019re going,\u201d a young woman held my hand from behind and questioned.</p><p> \u201cOh, so finally you ca\u2014I mean\u2026 you\u2026 are\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? A tease? Go on, say it. I know you want to say it. Shower me with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2026gorgeous,\u201d my mouth gasped to the sight of your white top beneath your pulled-up hair. \u201cI mean\u2026 No,\u201d I follow, back to my sane mind that was still mad at you, \u201cWhere have you been for god\u2019s sake?\u201d</p><p>You gave me a blank stare for a second and stepped back into the restaurant. I, helplessly, followed.</p><p>\u201cI mean if you don\u2019t want your gift, you can leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, miss, what gift? It\u2019s your birthday, pumpkin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet, you didn\u2019t even wish me a happy birthday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. I\u2019m sorry. Happy bi\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, dumbo. So, I missed your birthday, right? I was thinking, why not make this both of our birthdays. You know, I didn\u2019t want to miss your birthday, and we are already here. Why not? Your birthday comes first; it only makes sense if I say first, so here goes nothing: happy birthday, honey bunny. I wish you all the best in the world. That best is definitely me, but yeah, I wish you have me forever, dumbo.\u201d</p><p>I kind of felt bad at this moment. You thought of me more than I did of you. For real, I was just about to leave. Ouch, not again\u2026 the feel of guilt is sinking in. Not now, not today, please! I mean, what if your gift is better than mine? What if\u2014ouch again\u2026 I should say something. I can\u2019t just stare into the wall. How on earth did I forget to wish her birthday?</p><p>\u201cHappy birthday, pumpkin. I\u2019m so happy you\u2019re here today. My happiness is incomparable. I love you, little pumpkin,\u201d I say as you gaze upon the building to the face of the restaurant glassy fa\u00e7ade. </p><p>\u201cOh, the Northtower. It\u2019s less prestigious at night. I wonder if anything is happening there right now,\u201d I mentioned. </p><p>\u201cNothing much probably,\u201d you said, dozing off in the middle of the sentence before you came back to your senses and said: \u201cAhem. Sorry. So, like I was saying, it is only fair if I give you your gift first, and don\u2019t try to tell me no.\u201d</p><p>Yes, I was about to tell her that. I don\u2019t want to go first anyway. Probably will make up an excuse on how I forgot hers if the one she brought me is much better. </p><p>Here it comes.</p><p>\u201cSoooooooo\u2026 Ummm\u2026 ahh here we go\u2026 yup,\u201d you mumbled as you pulled it out of your bag, a rectangular wrap taking the shape of its contents, around 7 inches tall by 4.5 wide, I guess?</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to, really! Thank you, pumpkin\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I like the \u2018little\u2019 part the most, right? Don\u2019t forget it. This is a book, bunny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA book?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I wrote it\u2026 for you. It\u2019s more of a compilation of stories of us\u2026 some just you. Most of them just happened in my mind. I have been working on it for the past month or so and until this morning. I\u2019m sorry for being late, but it was at the printing facility and I had to wait for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could\u2019ve at least called.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knoooow. Just shut up and don\u2019t make me feel worse already.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t really want to give her the gift, now. Where was my mind? I got her a necklace. I could\u2019ve gotten her something better. She spent a whole month working on mine, which I didn\u2019t even know existed. </p><p>\u201cI love you. This is amazing\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2026 you are not going to kill me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKind of want to, but no\u2026 not today. You have a pass since it\u2019s your birthday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up. Where is my gift\u2026 huh\u2026 where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m your best gift, dumbo,\u201d I responded.</p><p>\u201cHaha, so funny. Now, where? I\u2019m getting impatient.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop. Listen, the gift I got for you is useless. I hate being in this situation. I\u2019m sorry,\u201d I claimed. </p><p>\u201cLucas,</p><p>\tBunny\u2026 just show me,\u201d you softened your voice. </p><p>\u201cHere. Don\u2019t laugh at me. I\u2019m sorry, and yeah\u2026 don\u2019t get mad. It\u2019s nothing compared to how much you worked on my gift. I could\u2019ve done better. It\u2019s your birthday since we got together and I hate this. Things were just cramped on top of each other. It\u2019s just that---\u201d</p><p>\u201cBunny, do you ever stop talking? I love it! This is the best gift anyone has ever gotten me.

Their teeth stemming from their golden fur gore the insides of the African grass-adorer, tearing their world of binarism apart.

They say sky and land, man and animal, dry and wet, cold and hot. They say, and say, and say\u2014and keep babbling in binaries: 01110011011101000110111101110000. Their binaries are well defined: a story of the zero and the one, or so is believed. A story that builds the universe: stripes of a zebra.</p><p>The zebras never agree. The river, from which our united dazzle of zebras hydrates their aching binary throats, or get asphyxiated by a hunching crocodile, flows. Everything flows and flows. A natural rhythmic gradient: sometimes laminar, sometimes turbulent. Alternating waves of steadiness and utter mess: spreading in all dimensions, more complicated than our simplistic understanding.</p><p>People always forget the world in-between, the gradient from black to red to white: the stains all-over. In the Serengeti, the world lays a fluid of sexual orientations\u2014not only a predetermined binary of black and white stripes. Stripes ever so contrasted you could believe a complete Utopia or an overarching Dystopia exists\u2014but it is also a fluid. You stare around, and you question light. What is light? Is sunlight through the glassy windows more of a light than my $3.99 candelabra light bulb seated inside the drum-shaped stand lamb by the left inner corner of my room, or are they both the same?
